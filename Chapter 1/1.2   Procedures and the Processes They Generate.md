#1.2  Procedures and the Processes They Generate

We have now considered the elements of programming: We have used primitive arithmetic operations, we have combined these operations, and we have abstracted these composite operations by defining them as compound procedures. But that is not enough to enable us to say that we know how to program. Our situation is analogous to that of someone who has learned the rules for how the pieces move in chess but knows nothing of typical openings, tactics, or strategy. Like the novice chess player, we don't yet know the common patterns of usage in the domain. We lack the knowledge of which moves are worth making (which procedures are worth defining). We lack the experience to predict the consequences of making a move (executing a procedure).

目前為止，我們考慮了程式的基本元素: 我們使用了原生運算符號、組合了不同的原生符號，並且定義這些組合為複合程序，以抽象化這些組合式的運算。但這樣還不夠，我們還沒辦法自稱我們懂如何寫程式。我們現在就像是一個剛學會西洋棋規則的玩家，儘管懂規則了，卻對各種經典開局、戰術、策略一無所知。我們尚不知道這個領域所常用到的一些基本模式，我們也不知道哪一步棋是值得我們下的(哪一個程序是值得我們拉出來做定義的)，我們也沒有足夠的經驗來預測下一步棋(執行一個程序)所會帶來的後果。

The ability to visualize the consequences of the actions under consideration is crucial to becoming an expert programmer, just as it is in any synthetic, creative activity. In becoming an expert photographer, for example, one must learn how to look at a scene and know how dark each region will appear on a print for each possible choice of exposure and development conditions. Only then can one reason backward, planning framing, lighting, exposure, and development to obtain the desired effects. So it is with programming, where we are planning the course of action to be taken by a process and where we control the process by means of a program. To become experts, we must learn to visualize the processes generated by various types of procedures. Only after we have developed such a skill can we learn to reliably construct programs that exhibit the desired behavior.

而這些能力對於成為一個專業的程式設計師來說是至關重要的，就如同在其他的創造活動中一樣。例如，如果你想成為一個專業攝影師，你必須學習如何觀看一個場景、了解在各種不同的曝光程度下，各個區塊在照片印出來之後的光影明暗程度等等。了解這些東西之後，你才能從你想要的結果往回推，設計適合的場景、光線、曝光程度等，才能獲得你想要得到的效果。寫程式也是一樣，我們先設計程式本身的意義，然後再往回設計執行時行程的行為以及對行程的控制。為了成為專家，我們必須學習並視覺化各種由程序組成的行程的樣子，唯有如此我們才能準確地建構出符合我們預期行為的程式。

A procedure is a pattern for the local evolution of a computational process. It specifies how each stage of the process is built upon the previous stage. We would like to be able to make statements about the overall, or global, behavior of a process whose local evolution has been specified by a procedure. This is very difficult to do in general, but we can at least try to describe some typical patterns of process evolution.

程序提供了一個樣式，讓運算行程自身能夠進化。程序定義了如何從行程的前一個階段建構成下一個階段。當一個行程的演化過程被程序所定義時，我們會希望能夠對這個行程做一個整體性的原則說明。一般來說這是件很難的事情，但至少我們可以試著描述這些行程演化時的一些典型的樣式。

In this section we will examine some common ``shapes'' for processes generated by simple procedures. We will also investigate the rates at which these processes consume the important computational resources of time and space. The procedures we will consider are very simple. Their role is like that played by test patterns in photography: as oversimplified prototypical patterns, rather than practical examples in their own right.

在這個章節，我們會介紹一些由簡單程序產生出來的行程的"形狀"，同時會探討這些行程分別使用多少的運算時間及運算空間資源。這些示範的行程會相當於攝影中的測試樣式：相較於實際使用的例子，他們會是非常簡化的、很原型的樣式。

#1.1 The Elements of Programming

A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

 - primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,

 - means of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and

 - means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. (Later we will discover that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is "stuff" that we want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.

In this chapter we will deal only with simple numerical data so that we can focus on the rules for building procedures.4 In later chapters we will see that these same rules allow us to build procedures to manipulate compound data as well.

一个强而有力的编程语言，其意义不仅仅止于指示电脑去完成工作。他更提供了我们对于组织程式流程之想法的框架。因此，当我们在描述一个语言时，应该更加关注在这个语言如何结合简单的想法去完成更多复杂的想法。每个强大的编程语言都有三种途径来达成这件事：

- **基本表达式(primitive expressions)** : 关于语言最基本的实体
- **组合之方法(means of combination)** : 将较为简单的元素结合为新的元素
- **抽象之方法(means of abstraction)** : 将元素组合为可运用并可命名之单位

在程式设计中，我们处理的元素可分为两类：**处理过程(procedure)** 和 **数据(data)** （之后我们会发现他们并没有很明显的区别）。
通俗地说，数据是我们想要操作的「原料」，而处理过程是我们对操作数据之规则的描述。因此，一个强大的语言应该要能够描述基本的数据和处理过程，并且提供组合及抽象化它们的方法。

在本章中，我们只处理简单的数值数据，以便专注于那些建立处理过程的规则。在稍后的章节，我们会看到这些规则同样可用以建立处理复杂数据的处理过程。

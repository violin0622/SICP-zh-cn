# 第一章 以过程构建抽象

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

> 人的心智活动透过简单的概念而发挥它的力量，方法主要可分为三种:
第一，把数个简单的概念组合成一个复合的概念，于是所有复杂的概念成焉。
第二，将两个概念——不论简单或复杂——不将它们结合，而是同时并列在一起观察，如此就能得知何为相互关联。
第三，把某些概念，从与其伴随的其他真实存在的概念中抽离出来，这称为**抽象化**，所有一般化、概化的概念皆是由此而生。

We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. 
As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. 
People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

我们打算要学习 **计算程式 (computational process)**。计算程式是居住在计算机里的抽象存在，它操控着另一种被称作数据的抽象事物。
而计算程序本身则是受到一种叫做 **程序 (program)** 的模式规则所控制。
人们通过编程来指示计算程序的行为，实际上就像发出魔法咒语控制计算机的灵魂。

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit.  It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. 
However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. 
The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. 
They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

计算程序确实像极了巫师的魔法，它既看不见也摸不着，根本就不是由实物组成的。
然而，它的确非常真实，它能做需要智力的工作，可以回答问题，可以通过在银行里支付金钱或者在工厂里控制机械手臂来影响现实世界。
我们用以驱使计算程式的程序就像是魔法师的咒语一样。
我们用神秘又深奥的编程语言，小心翼翼地组成一些符号语句以规范我们要计算程序执行的工作。

A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. 
Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. 
Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.

正常运转的计算机里，计算程式总是精准地执行工作。
因此如同见习魔法师一样，菜鸟程式员必须学习去理解并预估施展咒语的后果。
即使仅仅是程序里的微小错误 (通常叫 Bug 或故障) 也会造成复杂而无法预料的结果。

Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently contained in a secure way. 
Real-world programming, however, requires care, expertise, and wisdom. 
A small bug in a computer-aided design program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.

幸好学习写程序比学咒语安全多了，因为我们应付的小精灵们以一种安全的方式被束缚着。
然而真实世界里的程式设计依旧需要细心、专业知识和智慧。
举例来说，一个在计算机辅助设计系统里的小小 Bug ，可能导致飞机或水坝灾难性的损毁或者工业机器人自毁。

Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended. 
They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance. They know how to structure programs so that unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can debug their programs. 
Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

软件工程大师有组织程序的能力，所以他们有把握让计算程序执行的工作结果符合预期。
他们有办法预先看见系统的行为，知道怎么建构程式才不会使预料外的问题造成灾难，而且当问题发生时，他们能为程序除错。
设计良好的计算系统，就像设计良好的车子或核反应堆，是用模块化的方式设计的，因此总能分别地对每个子系统建构、替换、和除错。


## 用 Lisp 编程

We need an appropriate language for describing processes, and we will use for this purpose the programming language Lisp. 
Just as our everyday thoughts are usually expressed in our natural language (such as English, French, or Japanese), and descriptions of quantitative phenomena are expressed with mathematical notations, our procedural thoughts will be expressed in Lisp. 
Lisp was invented in the late 1950s as a formalism for reasoning about the use of certain kinds of logical expressions, called recursion equations, as a model for computation. 
The language was conceived by John McCarthy and is based on his paper "Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine" (McCarthy 1960).
 
我们需要一个合适的语言来描述计算程序，为此我们采用 Lisp 程式语言。
就像我们用自然语言(如英语、法语或日语) 来表达日常所思所想，用数学符号来描述定量现象一样，我们也用 Lisp 来描述有关计算程序的想法。
Lisp 发明于 1950 年代末， 是为了对一种特别的逻辑运算式(我们称之为递归方程)进行推理，作一种计算模型。
Lisp 语言是由约翰·麦卡锡(John McCarthy) 这位仁兄所构思出来的，根据他的论文《递归函数的符号表达式以及由机器运算的方式》 (McCarthy 1960)。

Despite its inception as a mathematical formalism, Lisp is a practical programming language. 
A Lisp interpreter is a machine that carries out processes described in the Lisp language. 
The first Lisp interpreter was implemented by McCarthy with the help of colleagues and students in the Artificial Intelligence Group of the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics and in the MIT Computation Center. [^1-en]
Lisp, whose name is an acronym for LISt Processing, was designed to provide symbol-manipulating capabilities for attacking programming problems such as the symbolic differentiation and integration of algebraic expressions. 
It included for this purpose new data objects known as atoms and lists, which most strikingly set it apart from all other languages of the period.

除了起初描述数学形式的目的，Lisp 也是个实用的编程语言。 Lisp 解释器是一个能执行 Lisp 语言写的程序的机器。
历史上第一个 Lisp 解释器，是在麻省理工学院计算中心的电子研究室里，由麦卡锡在人工智能小组的同事和学生们的协助下实现的。 [^1-zh]
Lisp 是 LISt Processing 的缩写 (意思是列表处理)。 Lisp 设计之初即具备符号处理的能力，能用于解决一些像对代数式做符号微分和积分的问题。
Lisp 包括了一些叫做**原子(Atoms)** 和**列表(Lists)**的崭新数据对象，这使它异于过去的其他编程语言。

Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort. Instead, it evolved informally in an experimental manner in response to users' needs and to pragmatic implementation considerations. 
Lisp's informal evolution has continued through the years, and the community of Lisp users has traditionally resisted attempts to promulgate any "official" definition of the language. 
This evolution, together with the flexibility and elegance of the initial conception, has enabled Lisp, which is the second oldest language in widespread use today (only Fortran is older), to continually adapt to encompass the most modern ideas about program design. 
Thus, Lisp is by now a family of dialects, which, while sharing most of the original features, may differ from one another in significant ways. The dialect of Lisp used in this book is called Scheme. [^2-en]

Lisp 并不是一个精心设计的成果，相反地，它是循着用户需求的反馈和实用上的考量，以一种实验性质的方式逐渐地演化而成的。 
Lisp 的非正式演化已经持续了多年，而且 Lisp 社群传统上刻意地避免去发布所谓「官方版」的 Lisp 语言。
伴随着 Lisp 最初构想的灵活和优雅，多年的演化使得 Lisp 这个世界上第二老的语言 (目前尚且广为使用的语言只有 Fortran 比它老) 得以不断的适应最新的程序设计理念。
因此现今的 Lisp 其实是一个有许多方言的语言家族，这个家族的成员都实现了 Lisp 的最初构想，但是可能在许多地方明显不同。本书所采用的 Lisp 方言叫做 Scheme 。[^2-zh]

Because of its experimental character and its emphasis on symbol manipulation, Lisp was at first very inefficient for numerical computations, at least in comparison with Fortran. 
Over the years, however, Lisp compilers have been developed that translate programs into machine code that can perform numerical computations reasonably efficiently. And for special applications, Lisp has been used with great effectiveness.[^3-en] 
Although Lisp has not yet overcome its old reputation as hopelessly inefficient, Lisp is now used in many applications where efficiency is not the central concern. 
For example, Lisp has become a language of choice for operating-system shell languages and for extension languages for editors and computer-aided design systems.
 
Lisp 一开始因为其实验性格和着重符号处理，导致它的数值运算非常慢，至少跟 Fortran 相比是如此。
但是经过了许多年的发展，Lisp 编译器现在可以将原始代码转换为可以以合理的效率运行的机器码。在某些特殊领域的应用 Lisp 发挥了巨大的成效。[^3-zh]
虽然 Lisp 还没完全摆脱过去低效的臭名，但现在已经有许多不以性能为首要考量的应用采用了 Lisp 。比方说作业系统的 Shell 语言，编辑器扩充插件或计算机辅助设计系统，Lisp 都是候选之一。

If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the framework for our discussion of programming? 
Because the language possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming constructs and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic features that support them.
The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data.
The importance of this is that there are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the traditional distinction between **passive** data and **active** processes.
As we shall discover, Lisp's flexibility in handling procedures as data makes it one of the most convenient languages in existence for exploring these techniques.
The ability to represent procedures as data also makes Lisp an excellent language for writing programs that must manipulate other programs as data, such as the interpreters and compilers that support computer languages.
Above and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.

既然 Lisp 并非一门主流语言，为什么本书仍要以其作为讨论程序设计的框架呢？
因为 Lisp 那些独一无二的语言特性使其成为一门优秀的学习重要的程序设计基础和数据结构的媒介，并能使程序员将编程基础及数据结构与 Lisp 的语言特性紧密结合。
其中最重要的特性是所谓的 **过程(procedure)**，即在 Lisp 程序中被描述的程序，其本身也可以作为 Lisp 数据进行表示和操作。
这一特性的重要性是在于强大的程序设计方法模糊了传统观念中"被动"的数据和"主动"的过程之间的界限。
正如我们将通过本书探索到的， Lisp 如数据一般操作过程的灵活性使之成为探索这种程序设计方法的最便捷的语言之一。
将过程表现为数据的特性亦使得 Lisp 能够写出将其他程序视为数据并进行操作的程序，如处理计算机语言的解释器和编译器，而成为一门杰出的程序设计语言。
除了以上这些优点之外，使用 Lisp 语言编写程序本身也充满乐趣。

[^1-en]: The *Lisp 1 Programmer's Manual* appeared in 1960, and the *Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual* (McCarthy 1965) was published in 1962. The early history of Lisp is described in McCarthy 1978. 

[^1-zh]: 《List 1 编程指南》诞生于 1960 年，《Lisp 1.5 编程指南》在 1962 年出版。 Lisp 的早期历史在《McCarthy 1978》中有描述。

[^2-en]: The two dialects in which most major Lisp programs of the 1970s were written are MacLisp (Moon 1978; Pitman 1983), developed at the MIT Project MAC, and Interlisp (Teitelman 1974), developed at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center. 
Portable Standard Lisp (Hearn 1969; Griss 1981) was a Lisp dialect designed to be easily portable between different machines. 
MacLisp spawned a number of subdialects, such as Franz Lisp, which was developed at the University of California at Berkeley, and Zetalisp (Moon 1981), which was based on a special-purpose processor designed at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to run Lisp very efficiently. 
The Lisp dialect used in this book, called Scheme (Steele 1975), was invented in 1975 by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and later reimplemented for instructional use at MIT.  Scheme became an IEEE standard in 1990 (IEEE 1990). 
The Common Lisp dialect (Steele 1982, Steele 1990) was developed by the Lisp community to combine features from the earlier Lisp dialects to make an industrial standard for Lisp. Common Lisp became an ANSI standard in 1994 (ANSI 1994).

[^2-zh]: 1970 年代最主流的两个 Lisp 方言是 MacLisp (Moon 1978; Pitman 1983)，由麻省理工 MAC 项目开发；以及 InterLisp (Teitelman 1974)，由 Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. 和 Xerox Palo Alto Research Center 开发。 
Portable Standard Lisp (Hearn 1969; Griss 1981) 是为了开发方便移植的 Lisp 程序。
MacLisp 衍生了一批方言，例如 Franz Lisp，由加州大学伯克利分校开发；Zetalisp (Moon 1981)，可以在麻省理工学院人工智能实验室设计的专用处理器上高效地运行。 
本书使用的方言叫做 Scheme ，由麻省理工学院人工智能实验室的 Guy Lwois Steele Jr. 和 Gerald Jay Sussman 在 1975 年开发， 并在之后为了教学目的而重新实现了一遍。Schem 在 1990 年成为 IEEE 标准(IEEE 1990)。
Common Lisp(Steele 1982, Steele 1990) 方言是由 Lisp 社区开发，组合了其他 Lisp 方言的特性，以图成为 Lisp 的工业标准。 Common Lisp 在 1994 年成为 ANSI 标准(ANSI 1994)。

[^3-en]: One such special application was a breakthrough computation of scientific importance -- an integration of the motion of the Solar System that extended previous results by nearly two orders of magnitude, and demonstrated that the dynamics of the Solar System is chaotic. 
This computation was made possible by new integration algorithms, a special-purpose compiler, and a special-purpose computer all implemented with the aid of software tools written in Lisp (Abelson et al. 1992; Sussman and Wisdom 1992).

[^3-zh]: 这方便有一个应用是在科学计算方面的重要突破——太阳系运动的整合，它将以前的结果提高了两个数量级，并显示出太阳系统动力学的混沌性。
完成这种计算依靠了一种新的整合算法，一个特殊的编译器和一台专用的计算机。 所有这些都是在 Lisp 的帮助下实现的(Abelson et al. 1992; Sussman and Wisdom 1992)。
